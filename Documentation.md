###Creating and linking the CloudFS Sessions

Sessions represent connections to CloudFS. They use a set of credentials that consists of an end point URL, a client ID and a client secret. These credentials can be obtained via the Bitcasa admin console.

[Session](CloudFS/Session.html) - Performs regular file system operations.

```ruby
session = CloudFS::Session.new(end_point, client_id, client_secret)
```

A user can be linked to the session by authenticating using a username and a password.

```ruby
session.authenticate(username, password)
```

You can assert whether a user is linked to the session.

```ruby
session.is_linked?
```

The currently linked user can be unlinked from the session.

```ruby
session.unlink
```

**Note:**

+  Only one user can be linked to a session at a time.

You need to create an admin session in order to perform admin operations.
